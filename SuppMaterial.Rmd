![**Supp. Figure 2. Ammonium, orthophosphate, and nitrate levels.** Ammonium, orthophosphate, nitrate absorbances were determined using a colorimetric spectrophotometer with 96 well plates. Absorbances were calculated and converted to concentrations of mg per g soil. Statistically significant differences between the control and heated samples are indicated by a bracket and asterisk (Miranda et al., 2001; Rhine et al., 1998; Ringuet et al., 2011).
