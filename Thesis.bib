	abstract = {Abstract. Projections of future climate change play a fundamental role in improving understanding of the climate system as well as characterizing societal risks and response options. The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 °C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017–2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018–2020 period.},

	abstract = {Global change is altering species distributions and thus interactions among organisms. Organisms live in concert with thousands of other species, some beneficial, some pathogenic, some which have little to no effect in complex communities. Since natural communities are composed of organisms with very different life history traits and dispersal ability it is unlikely they will all respond to climatic change in a similar way. Disjuncts in plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions under global change have been relatively well described, but plant-soil microorganism and soil microbe-microbe relationships have received less attention. Since soil microorganisms regulate nutrient transformations, provide plants with nutrients, allow co-existence among neighbors, and control plant populations, changes in soil microorganism-plant interactions could have significant ramifications for plant community composition and ecosystem function. In this paper we explore how climatic change affects soil microbes and soil microbe-plant interactions directly and indirectly, discuss what we see as emerging and exciting questions and areas for future research, and discuss what ramifications changes in these interactions may have on the composition and function of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Root exudation is an important plant process by which roots release small molecules into the rhizosphere that serve in overall plant functioning. Yet, there is a major gap in our knowledge in translating plant root exudation in artificial systems (i.e., hydroponics, sterile media) to crops, specifically for soils expected in field conditions. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) root exudation was determined using both ultra-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics to evaluate variation in exudate composition of two sorghum genotypes among three substrates (sand, clay, and soil). Above and belowground plant traits were measured to determine the interaction between sorghum genotype and belowground substrate. Plant growth and quantitative exudate composition were found to vary largely by substrate. Two types of changes to rhizosphere metabolites were observed: rhizosphere-enhanced metabolites (REMs) and rhizosphere-abated metabolites (RAMs). More REMs and RAMs were detected in sand and clay substrates compared to the soil substrate. This study demonstrates that belowground substrate influences the root exudate profile in sorghum, and that two sorghum genotypes exuded metabolites at different magnitudes. However, metabolite identification remains a major bottleneck in non-targeted metabolite profiling of the rhizosphere.},

	abstract = {Literature surveys, taxonomical differences, and bioassay results have been utilized in the discovery of new natural products to aid in Actinomycetes isolate-selection. However, no or less investigation have been done on establishing the differences in metabolomic profiles of the isolated microorganisms. The study aims to utilise bioassay- and metabolomics-guided tools that included dereplication study and multivariate analysis of the NMR and mass spectral data of microbial extracts to assist the selection of isolates for scaling-up the production of antimicrobial natural products. A total of 58 actinomycetes were isolated from different soil samples collected from Ihnasia City, Egypt and screened for their antimicrobial activities against indicator strains that included Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. A number of 25 isolates were found to be active against B. subtilis and/or to at least one of the tested indicator strains. Principal component analyses showed chemical uniqueness for four outlying bioactive actinomycetes extracts. In addition, Orthogonal Projections to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) and dereplication study led us to further select two outlying anti-MRSA active isolates MS.REE.13 and 22 for scale-up work. MS.REE.13 and 22 exhibited zones of inhibition at 19 and 13 mm against MRSA, respectively. A metabolomics-guided approach provided the steer to target the bioactive metabolites (P{\textless}0.01) present in a crude extract or fraction even at nanogram levels but it was a challenge that such low-yielding bioactive natural products would be feasible to isolate. Validated to occur only on the active side of OPLS-DA loadings plot, the isolated compounds exhibited medium to weak antibiotic activity with MIC values between 250 and 800 μM. Two new compounds, P\_24306 (C10H13N2) and N\_12799 (C18H32O3) with MICs of 795 and 432 μM, were afforded from the scale-up of MS.REE. 13 and 22, respectively.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1618782114},
	abstract = {The developmental plasticity of plants relies on the remarkable ability of the meristems to integrate nutrient and energy availability with environmental signals. Meristems in root and shoot apexes share highly similar molecular players but are spatially separated by soil. Whether and how these two meristematic tissues have differential activation requirements for local nutrient, hormone, and environmental cues (e.g., light) remain enigmatic in photosynthetic plants. Here, we report that the activation of root and shoot apexes relies on distinct glucose and light signals. Glucose energy signaling is sufficient to activate target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase in root apexes. In contrast, both the glucose and light signals are required for TOR activation in shoot apexes. Strikingly, exogenously applied auxin is able to replace light to activate TOR in shoot apexes and promote true leaf development. A relatively low concentration of auxin in the shoot and high concentration of auxin in the root might be responsible for this distinctive light requirement in root and shoot apexes, because light is required to promote auxin biosynthesis in the shoot. Furthermore, we reveal that the small GTPase Rho-related protein 2 (ROP2) transduces light-auxin signal to activate TOR by direct interaction, which, in turn, promotes transcription factors E2Fa,b for activating cell cycle genes in shoot apexes. Consistently, constitutively activated ROP2 plants stimulate TOR in the shoot apex and cause true leaf development even without light. Together, our findings establish a pivotal hub role of TOR signaling in integrating different environmental signals to regulate distinct developmental transition and growth in the shoot and root.},

	abstract = {Climate change is causing shifts in precipitation patterns in the central grasslands of the United States, with largely unknown consequences on the collective physiological responses of the soil microbial community, i.e., the metaphenome. Here, we used an untargeted omics approach to determine the soil microbial community's metaphenomic response to soil moisture and to define specific metabolic signatures of the response. Specifically, we aimed to develop the technical approaches and metabolic mapping framework necessary for future systematic ecological studies. We collected soil from three locations at the Konza Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) field station in Kansas, and the soils were incubated for 15 days under dry or wet conditions and compared to field-moist controls. The microbiome response to wetting or drying was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, and the resulting shifts in taxa, gene expression, and metabolites were assessed. Soil drying resulted in significant shifts in both the composition and function of the soil microbiome. In contrast, there were few changes following wetting. The combined metabolic and metatranscriptomic data were used to generate reaction networks to determine the metaphenomic response to soil moisture transitions. Site location was a strong determinant of the response of the soil microbiome to moisture perturbations. However, some specific metabolic pathways changed consistently across sites, including an increase in pathways and metabolites for production of sugars and other osmolytes as a response to drying. Using this approach, we demonstrate that despite the high complexity of the soil habitat, it is possible to generate insight into the effect of environmental change on the soil microbiome and its physiology and functions, thus laying the groundwork for future, targeted studies.IMPORTANCE Climate change is predicted to result in increased drought extent and intensity in the highly productive, former tallgrass prairie region of the continental United States. These soils store large reserves of carbon. The decrease in soil moisture due to drought has largely unknown consequences on soil carbon cycling and other key biogeochemical cycles carried out by soil microbiomes. In this study, we found that soil drying had a significant impact on the structure and function of soil microbial communities, including shifts in expression of specific metabolic pathways, such as those leading toward production of osmoprotectant compounds. This study demonstrates the application of an untargeted multi-omics approach to decipher details of the soil microbial community's metaphenotypic response to environmental perturbations and should be applicable to studies of other complex microbial systems as well.},

The cultivar Ningqi1, widely grown in Northwest China was collected from three typical ecological growing counties with contrasting climatic conditions: Ningxia Zhongning (NF), Xinjiang Jinghe (XF) and Qinghai Nomuhong (QF). During the ripening period, 45 fruits from different plantations at each location were sampled. A total of 393 metabolites were detected in all samples through the widely targeted metabolomics approach and grouped into 19 known classes. Fruits from QF were the biggest followed by those from XF and NF. The altitude, relative humidity and light intensity had negative and strong correlations with most of the metabolites, suggesting that growing wolfberry in very high altitudes and under high light intensity is detrimental for the fruit nutritional quality. Soil moisture content is highly and negatively correlated with vitamins, organic acids and carbohydrates while moderately and positively correlated with other classes of metabolites. In contrast, air and soil temperatures exhibited positive correlation with majority of the metabolites. Overall, our results suggest high soil and air temperatures, low altitude and light intensity and moderate soil moisture, as the suitable conditions to produce Lycium fruits with high content of nutritious metabolites.},

	abstract = {Inter-organismal communications below ground, such as plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere, affect plant growth. Metabolites are shown to play important roles in biological communication, but there still remain a large number of metabolites in soil to be uncovered. Metabolomics, a technique for the comprehensive analysis of metabolites in samples, may uncover the molecules that intermediate these interactions. We conducted a multivariate analysis using liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomics in several soil samples and also targeted metabolome analysis for the identification of the candidate compounds in soil. We identified okaramine A, B, and C in the rhizosphere soil of hairy vetch. Okaramines are indole alkaloids first identified in soybean pulp (okara) inoculated with Penicillium simplicissimum AK-40 and are insecticidal. Okaramine B was detected in the rhizosphere from an open field growing hairy vetch. Okaramine B was also detected in both bulk and rhizosphere soils of soybean grown following hairy vetch, but not detected in soils of soybean without hairy vetch growth. These results suggested that okaramines might be involved in indirect defense of plants against insects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of okaramines in the natural environment. Untargeted and targeted metabolomics would be useful to uncover the chemistry of the rhizosphere.},

	abstract = {Oligogalacturonides (OGs) are fragments of pectin released from the plant cell wall during insect or pathogen attack. They can be perceived by the plant as damage signals, triggering local and systemic defence responses. Here, we analyse the dynamics of local and systemic responses to OG perception in tomato roots or shoots, exploring their impact across the plant and their relevance in pathogen resistance. Targeted and untargeted metabolomics and gene expression analysis in plants treated with purified OGs revealed that local responses were transient, while distal responses were stronger and more sustained. Remarkably, changes were more conspicuous in roots, even upon foliar application of the OGs. The treatments differentially activated the synthesis of defence-related hormones and secondary metabolites including flavonoids, alkaloids and lignans, some of them exclusively synthetized in roots. Finally, the biological relevance of the systemic defence responses activated upon OG perception was confirmed, as the treatment induced systemic resistance to Botrytis cinerea. Overall, this study shows the differential regulation of tomato defences upon OGs perception in roots and shoots and reveals the key role of roots in the coordination of the plant responses to damage sensing.},

Moreover, even for potential nutrients, the exact relation between the metabolic value of chemicals and their efficiency as chemoattractants has not been systematically explored. Here we compare the chemotactic response of amino acids with their use by bacteria for two well-established models of chemotactic behavior, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. We demonstrate that in E. coli chemotaxis toward amino acids indeed strongly correlates with their utilization. However, no such correlation is observed for B. subtilis, suggesting that in this case, the amino acids are not followed because of their nutritional value but rather as environmental cues.},

However, these algorithms rely on consistent formatting of data, turning unstructured clinical data into semi-structured data, and reliably annotating putative structures from mass spectrometry data, which are significant challenges. In addition, the complexity of biological systems complicates modeling outside of specific metabolic pathways or genetic interactions; but hidden within this complexity are the biochemical fingerprints that can enable personalized treatment. Indeed, combining analyses of the -omics fields along the structure of the central dogma of biology would represents a herculean task, but would yield incredible predictive power.

Three ongoing field studies at the Harvard Forest Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site (Petersham, MA) have warmed soils 5°C above ambient temperatures for 5, 8, and 20 years. We used this chronosequence to test the hypothesis that soil microbial communities have changed in response to chronic warming. Bacterial community composition was studied using Illumina sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, and bacterial and fungal abundance were assessed using quantitative PCR. Only the 20-year warmed site exhibited significant change in bacterial community structure in the organic soil horizon, with no significant changes in the mineral soil. The dominant taxa, abundant at 0.1\% or greater, represented 0.3\% of the richness but nearly 50\% of the observations (sequences). Individual members of the Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria showed strong warming responses, with one Actinomycete decreasing from 4.5 to 1\% relative abundance with warming. Ribosomal RNA copy number can obfuscate community profiles, but is also correlated with maximum growth rate or trophic strategy among bacteria. Ribosomal RNA copy number correction did not affect community profiles, but rRNA copy number was significantly decreased in warming plots compared to controls. Increased bacterial evenness, shifting beta diversity, decreased fungal abundance and increased abundance of bacteria with low rRNA operon copy number, including Alphaproteobacteria and Acidobacteria, together suggest that more or alternative niche space is being created over the course of long-term warming.},

Previous studies reported that soil drench application of this acid induces effective resistance in tomato plants against Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae and in citrus against Alternaria alternata and Xanthomonas citri. In this work, we performed an in deep study of the metabolic changes produced in citrus by the application of Hx in response to the challenge pathogen A. alternata, focusing on the response of the plant. Moreover, we used (13)C labeled hexanoic to analyze its behavior inside the plants. Finally, we studied the volatile emission of the treated plants after the challenge inoculation. Drench application of (13)C labeled hexanoic demonstrated that this molecule stays in the roots and is not mobilized to the leaves, suggesting long distance induction of resistance. Moreover, the study of the metabolic profile showed an alteration of more than 200 molecules differentially induced by the application of the compound and the inoculation with the fungus. Bioinformatics analysis of data showed that most of these altered molecules could be related with the mevalonic and linolenic pathways suggesting the implication of these pathways in the induced resistance mediated by Hx. Finally, the application of this compound showed an enhancement of the emission of 17 volatile metabolites. Taken together, this study indicates that after the application of Hx this compound remains in the roots, provoking molecular changes that may trigger the defensive response in the rest of the plant mediated by changes in the mevalonic and linolenic pathways and enhancing the emission of volatile compounds, suggesting for the first time the implication of mevalonic pathway in response to hexanoic application.},

Understanding sources of chemical variation of potato tuber can inform breeding for improved health attributes of the cooked food. Here, a comprehensive metabolomics (UPLC- and GC-MS) and ionomics (ICP-MS) analysis of raw and cooked potato tuber was performed on 60 unique potato genotypes that span 5 market classes including russet, red, yellow, chip, and specialty potatoes. The analyses detected 2,656 compounds that included known bioactives (43 compounds), nutrients (42), lipids (76), and 23 metals. Most nutrients and bioactives were partially degraded during cooking (44 out of 85; 52\%), however genotypes with high quantities of bioactives remained highest in the cooked tuber. Chemical variation was influenced by genotype and market class. Specifically, {\textasciitilde}53\% of all detected compounds from cooked potato varied among market class and 40\% varied by genotype. The most notable metabolite profiles were observed in yellow-flesh potato which had higher levels of carotenoids and specialty potatoes which had the higher levels of chlorogenic acid as compared to the other market classes. Variation in several molecules with known association to health was observed among market classes and included vitamins (e.g., pyridoxal, {\textasciitilde}2-fold variation), bioactives (e.g., chlorogenic acid, {\textasciitilde}40-fold variation), medicinals (e.g., kukoamines, {\textasciitilde}6-fold variation), and minerals (e.g., calcium, iron, molybdenum, {\textasciitilde}2-fold variation). Furthermore, more metabolite variation was observed within market class than among market class (e.g., α-tocopherol, {\textasciitilde}1-fold variation among market class vs. {\textasciitilde}3-fold variation within market class).

The systemic response, mainly comprising increased Pi uptake and metabolic adjustments for more efficient Pi use, and the local response, enabling plants to explore Pi-rich soil patches by reorganization of the root system architecture. Unlike previous reports, this study focused on root exudation controlled by the local response to Pi deficiency. To approach this, a hydroponic system separating the local and systemic responses was developed. Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes exhibiting distinct sensitivities to Pi deficiency could be clearly distinguished by their root exudate composition as determined by non-targeted reversed-phase ultraperformance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry metabolite profiling. Compared with wild-type plants or insensitive low phosphate root 1 and 2 (lpr1 lpr2) double mutant plants, the hypersensitive phosphate deficiency response 2 (pdr2) mutant exhibited a reduced number of differential features in root exudates after Pi starvation, suggesting the involvement of PDR2-encoded P5-type ATPase in root exudation. Identification and analysis of coumarins revealed common and antagonistic regulatory pathways between Pi and Fe deficiency-induced coumarin secretion. The accumulation of oligolignols in root exudates after Pi deficiency was inversely correlated with Pi starvation-induced lignification at the root tips. The strongest oligolignol accumulation in root exudates was observed for the insensitive lpr1 lpr2 double mutant, which was accompanied by the absence of Pi deficiency-induced lignin deposition, suggesting a role of LPR ferroxidases in lignin polymerization during Pi starvation.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims: Suaeda maritima is a halophyte commonly found on coastal wetlands in the intertidal zone. Due to its habitat S. maritima has evolved tolerance to high salt concentrations and hypoxic conditions in the soil caused by periodic flooding. In the present work, the adaptive mechanisms of S. maritima to salinity combined with hypoxia were investigated on a physiological and metabolic level.
Methods: To compare the adaptive mechanisms to deficient, optimal and stressful salt concentrations, S. maritima plants were grown in a hydroponic culture under low, medium and high salt concentrations. Additionally, hypoxic conditions were applied to investigate the impact of hypoxia combined with different salt concentrations. A non-targeted metabolic approach was used to clarify the biochemical pathways underlying the metabolic and physiological adaptation mechanisms of S. maritima .
Key Results: Roots exposed to hypoxic conditions showed an increased level of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)-cycle intermediates such as succinate, malate and citrate. During hypoxia, the concentration of free amino acids increased in shoots and roots. Osmoprotectants such as proline and glycine betaine increased in concentrations as the external salinity was increased under hypoxic conditions.
Conclusions: The combination of high salinity and hypoxia caused an ionic imbalance and an increase of metabolites associated with osmotic stress and photorespiration, indicating a severe physiological and metabolic response under these conditions. Disturbed proline degradation in the roots induced an enhanced proline accumulation under hypoxia. The enhanced alanine fermentation combined with a partial flux of the TCA cycle might contribute to the tolerance of S. maritima to hypoxic conditions.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms that can contribute in the fish movement strategies and the associated behaviour can be complex and related to the physiology, genetic and ecology of each species. In the case of the brown trout (Salmo trutta), in recent research works, individual differences in mobility have been observed in a population living in a high mountain river reach (Pyrenees, NE Spain). The population is mostly sedentary but a small percentage of individuals exhibit a mobile behavior, mainly upstream movements. Metabolomics can reflect changes in the physiological process and can determine different profiles depending on behaviour. Here, a non-targeted metabolomics approach was used to find possible changes in the blood metabolomic profile of S. trutta related to its movement behaviour, using a minimally invasive sampling. Results showed a differentiation in the metabolomic profiles of the trouts and different level concentrations of some metabolites (e.g. cortisol) according to the home range classification (pattern of movements: sedentary or mobile). The change in metabolomic profiles can generally occur during the upstream movement and probably reflects the changes in metabolite profile from the non-mobile season to mobile season.

	abstract = {Lettuce is an important leafy vegetable that represents a significant dietary source of antioxidants and bioactive compounds. However, the levels of metabolites in different lettuce cultivars are poorly characterized. In this study, we used combined GC × GC-TOF/MS and UPLC-IMS-QTOF/MS to detect and relatively quantify metabolites in 30 lettuce cultivars representing large genetic diversity. Comparison with online databases, the published literature, standards as well using collision cross-section values enabled putative identification of 171 metabolites. Sixteen of these 171 metabolites (including phenolic acid derivatives, glycosylated flavonoids, and one iridoid) were present at significantly different levels in leaf and head type lettuces, which suggested the significant metabolomic variations between the leaf and head types of lettuce are related to secondary metabolism. A combination of the results and metabolic network analysis techniques suggested that leaf and head type lettuces contain not only different levels of metabolites but also have significant variations in the corresponding associated metabolic networks. The novel lettuce metabolite library and novel non-targeted metabolomics strategy devised in this study could be used to further characterize metabolic variations between lettuce cultivars or other plants. Moreover, the findings of this study provide important insight into metabolic adaptations due to natural and human selection, which could stimulate further research to potentially improve lettuce quality, yield, and nutritional value.},

So far, algal responses were mainly investigated at apical levels hampering the acquisition of a holistic view on primary, adaptive, and compensatory stress responses. We assessed responses of the chlorophyte Scenedesmus vacuolatus to triclosan at apical (growth, photosynthesis) and molecular (transcriptome, metabolome) levels for comparative pathway sensitivity analysis. For each responsive signal (contigs, metabolites), a concentration-response curve was modeled and effect concentrations were calculated leading to the setting of cumulative sensitivity distributions. Molecular responses showed higher sensitivity than apical observations. The functional annotation of contigs and metabolites revealed 118 metabolic pathways putatively impaired by triclosan, highlighting a wide repercussion on the algal metabolism. Metabolites involved in the lipid metabolism showed decreasing trends along the concentration gradient and a globally highest sensitivity, pointing to the primary target of triclosan. The pathways involved in xenobiotic degradation and membrane transporters were mainly regulated in the transcriptome with increasing response trends comprising compensatory responses. The suggested novel approach, combining apical and multi-omics analyses in a concentration-response framework improves mechanistic understanding and mode of action analysis on non-targeted organisms and is suggested to better implement high-throughput multi-omics data in environmental risk assessment.},

METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: The experimental material consisted in eight sunflower lines with two line status, four restorers (R, used as males) and four maintainers (B, corresponding to females) routinely used for sunflower hybrid varietal production, respectively to complement or maintain the cytoplasmic male sterility PET1. These lines were either irrigated at full soil capacity (WW) or submitted to drought stress (DS). Our aim was to combine targeted and non-targeted metabolomics to characterize sunflower leaf composition in order to investigate the effect of line status genotypes and environmental conditions and to find the best and smallest set of biomarkers for line status and stress response using a custom-made process of variables selection.
RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-eight metabolic variables were measured by using complementary analytical methods such as 1H-NMR, MS-based profiles and targeted analyses of major metabolites. Based on statistical analyses, a limited number of markers were able to separate WW and DS samples in a more discriminant manner than previously published physiological data. Another metabolic marker set was able to discriminate line status.
CONCLUSION: This study underlines the potential of metabolic markers for discriminating genotype groups and environmental conditions. Their potential use for prediction is discussed.},

This study aimed to reveal the metagenomic and metabolomic changes between the healthy- and obstacle-plant after a long period of continuous cropping. After 10 years of continuous cropping, ramie planted in some portions of the land exhibited weak growth and low yield (Obstacle-group), whereas, ramie planted in the other portion of the land grew healthy (Health-group). We collected rhizosphere soil and root samples from which measurements of soil chemical and plant physiochemical properties were taken. All samples were subjected to non-targeted gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GS/MS) metabolome analysis. Further, metagenomics was performed to analyze the functional genes in rhizospheric soil organisms. Based on the findings, ramie in Obstacle-group were characterized by shorter plant height, smaller stem diameter, and lower fiber production than that in Health-group. Besides, the Obstacle-group showed a lower relative abundance of Rhizobiaceae, Lysobacter antibioticus, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum, but a higher relative abundance of Azospirillum lipoferum and A. brasilense compared to the Health-group. Metabolomic analysis results implicated cysteinylglycine (Cys-Gly), uracil, malonate, and glycerol as the key differential metabolites between the Health- and Obstacle-group. Notably, this work revealed that bacteria such as Rhizobia potentially synthesize IAA and are likely to reduce the biotic stress of ramie. L. antibioticus also exerts a positive effect on plants in the fight against biotic stress and is mediated by metabolites including orthophosphate, uracil, and Cys-Gly, which may serve as markers for disease risk. These bacterial effects can play a key role in plant resistance to biotic stress via metabolic and methionine metabolism pathways.},

It represents a complementary strategy, or sustainable alternative that can provide protection against disease. However, a comprehensive functional and mechanistic understanding of the various layers of priming events is still limited. A non-targeted metabolomics approach was used to investigate metabolic changes in plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)-primed Sorghum bicolor seedlings infected with the anthracnose-causing fungal pathogen, Colletotrichum sublineolum, with a focus on the post-challenge primed state phase. At the 4-leaf growth stage, the plants were treated with a strain of Paenibacillus alvei at 108 cfu mL-1. Following a 24 h PGPR application, the plants were inoculated with a C. sublineolum spore suspension (106 spores mL-1), and the infection monitored over time: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 days post-inoculation. Non-infected plants served as negative controls. Intracellular metabolites from both inoculated and non-inoculated plants were extracted with 80\% methanol-water. The extracts were chromatographically and spectrometrically analysed on an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) system coupled to high-definition mass spectrometry. The acquired multidimensional data were processed to create data matrices for chemometric modelling. The computed models indicated time-related metabolic perturbations that reflect primed responses to the fungal infection. Evaluation of orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) loading shared and unique structures (SUS)-plots uncovered the differential stronger defence responses against the fungal infection observed in primed plants. These involved enhanced levels of amino acids (tyrosine, tryptophan), phytohormones (jasmonic acid and salicylic acid conjugates, and zeatin), and defence-related components of the lipidome. Furthermore, other defence responses in both naïve and primed plants were characterised by a complex mobilisation of phenolic compounds and de novo biosynthesis of the flavones, apigenin and luteolin and the 3-deoxyanthocyanidin phytoalexins, apigeninidin and luteolinidin, as well as some related conjugates.},

Phytophthora capsici is an oomycete that causes blight and fruit rot in important crops, especially those in the Solanaceae family. P. capsici infection is difficult to control due to genetic diversity, arising from sexual reproduction, and resistant spores that remain dormant in soil. In this study, the metabolomics of tomato plants responding to infection by P. capsici were investigated. Non-targeted metabolomics, based on liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), were used with multivariate data analyses to investigate time-dependent metabolic reprogramming in the roots, stems, and leaves of stem-infected plants, over an 8 day period. In addition, phytohormones and amino acids were determined using quantitative LC-MS. Methyl salicylate and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate were detected as major signalling molecules in the defensive response to P. capsici. As aromatic amino acid precursors of secondary metabolic pathways, both phenylalanine and tryptophan showed a continuous increase over time in all tissues, whereas tyrosine peaked at day 4. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed phenylpropanoids, benzoic acids, glycoalkaloids, flavonoids, amino acids, organic acids, and fatty acids as the major classes of reprogrammed metabolites. Correlation analysis showed that metabolites derived from the same pathway, or synthesised by different pathways, could either have a positive or negative correlation. Furthermore, roots, stems, and leaves showed contrasting time-dependent metabolic reprogramming, possibly related to the biotrophic vs. necrotrophic life-stages of the pathogen, and overlapping biotic and abiotic stress signaling. As such, the targeted and untargeted approaches complemented each other, to provide a detailed view of key time-dependent metabolic changes, occurring in both the asymptomatic and symptomatic stages of infection.},

	abstract = {Background
GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) is a non protein amino acid that has been reported to accumulate in a number of plant species when subjected to high salinity and many other environmental constraints. However, no experimental data are to date available on the molecular function of GABA and the involvement of its metabolism in salt stress tolerance in higher plants. Here, we investigated the regulation of GABA metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana at the metabolite, enzymatic activity and gene transcription levels upon NaCl stress.

Results
We identified the GABA transaminase (GABA-T), the first step of GABA catabolism, as the most responsive to NaCl. We further performed a functional analysis of the corresponding gene POP2 and demonstrated that the previously isolated loss-of-function pop2-1 mutant was oversensitive to ionic stress but not to osmotic stress suggesting a specific role in salt tolerance. NaCl oversensitivity was not associated with overaccumulation of Na+ and Cl- but mutant showed a slight decrease in K+. To bring insights into POP2 function, a promoter-reporter gene strategy was used and showed that POP2 was mainly expressed in roots under control conditions and was induced in primary root apex and aerial parts of plants in response to NaCl. Additionally, GC-MS- and UPLC-based metabolite profiling revealed major changes in roots of pop2-1 mutant upon NaCl stress including accumulation of amino acids and decrease in carbohydrates content.

Conclusions
GABA metabolism was overall up-regulated in response to NaCl in Arabidopsis. Particularly, GABA-T was found to play a pivotal function and impairment of this step was responsible for a decrease in salt tolerance indicating that GABA catabolism was a determinant of Arabidopsis salt tolerance. GABA-T would act in salt responses in linking N and C metabolisms in roots.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, the development of new technologies applied to lipidomics has revitalized the analysis of lipid profile alterations and the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism, together with their involvement in the occurrence of human disease. Of particular interest is the study of omega-3 and omega-6 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), notably EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5n-3), DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6n-3), and ARA (arachidonic acid, 20:4n-6), and their transformation into bioactive lipid mediators. In this sense, new families of PUFA-derived lipid mediators, including resolvins derived from EPA and DHA, and protectins and maresins derived from DHA, are being increasingly investigated because of their active role in the "return to homeostasis" process and resolution of inflammation. Recent findings reviewed in the present study highlight that the omega-6 fatty acid ARA appears increased, and omega-3 EPA and DHA decreased in most cancer tissues compared to normal ones, and that increments in omega-3 LC-PUFAs consumption and an omega-6/omega-3 ratio of 2-4:1, are associated with a reduced risk of breast, prostate, colon and renal cancers. Along with their lipid-lowering properties, omega-3 LC-PUFAs also exert cardioprotective functions, such as reducing platelet aggregation and inflammation, and controlling the presence of DHA in our body, especially in our liver and brain, which is crucial for optimal brain functionality. Considering that DHA is the principal omega-3 FA in cortical gray matter, the importance of DHA intake and its derived lipid mediators have been recently reported in patients with major depressive and bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study reviews the relationships between major diseases occurring today in the Western world and LC-PUFAs. More specifically this review focuses on the dietary omega-3 LC-PUFAs and the omega-6/omega-3 balance, in a wide range of inflammation disorders, including autoimmune diseases. This review suggests that the current recommendations of consumption and/or supplementation of omega-3 FAs are specific to particular groups of age and physiological status, and still need more fine tuning for overall human health and well being.},

Multi-omic analyses, however, do have sample preparation challenges, since separate extractions are typically needed for each omic study, thereby greatly amplifying the preparation time and amount of sample required. To address this limitation, a 3-in-1 method for the simultaneous extraction of metabolites, proteins, and lipids (MPLEx) from the same soil sample was created by adapting a solvent-based approach. This MPLEx protocol has proven to be both simple and robust for many sample types, even when utilized for limited quantities of complex soil samples.

	abstract = {Ascaris is a soil-transmitted nematode that causes ascariasis, a neglected tropical disease affecting predominantly children and adolescents in the tropics and subtropics. Approximately 0.8 billion people are affected worldwide, equating to 0.86 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Exploring the molecular biology of Ascaris is important to gain a better understanding of the host-parasite interactions and disease processes, and supports the development of novel interventions. Although advances have been made in the genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics of Ascaris, its lipidome has received very limited attention. Lipidomics is an important sub-discipline of systems biology, focused on exploring lipids profiles in tissues and cells, and elucidating their biological and metabolic roles. Here, we characterised the lipidomes of key developmental stages and organ systems of Ascaris of porcine origin via high throughput LC-MS/MS. In total, {\textgreater} 500 lipid species belonging to 18 lipid classes within three lipid categories were identified and quantified-in precise molar amounts in relation to the dry weight of worm material-in different developmental stages/sexes and organ systems. The results showed substantial differences in the composition and abundance of lipids with key roles in cellular processes and functions (e.g. energy storage regulation and membrane structure) among distinct stages and among organ systems, likely reflecting differing demands for lipids, depending on stage of growth and development as well as the need to adapt to constantly changing environments within and outside of the host animal. This work provides the first step toward understanding the biology of lipids in Ascaris, with possibilities to work toward designing new interventions against ascariasis.},

The global analysis of complex lipids is very challenging due to the extreme diversity in lipid structures. Variation in linkages and positions of fatty acyl chain(s) on the lipid backbone, functional group modification, occurrence of the molecular species as isomers or isobars are among some of the greatest challenges to resolve in lipidomics. In this work, we describe a routine analytical approach combining two liquid chromatography platforms: hydrophilic interaction (HILIC) and C30 reversed-phase chromatography (C30RP) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) as complementary high throughput platforms to analyze complex lipid mixtures. Vascular plants (kale leaves and corn roots), rat brain and soil microbes were used as proxies to evaluate the efficiency of the enhanced approach to resolve traditional, as well as, modified lipids during routine lipidomics analysis. We report for the first time, the observation of a modified class of acylphosphatidylglycerol (acylPG) in corn roots by HILIC, and further resolution of the isomers using C30RP chromatography. We also used this approach to demonstrate the presence of high levels of N-monomethyl phosphatidylethanolamine (MMPE) in soil microbes, as well as to determine the regioisomers of lysophospholipids in kale leaves. Additionally, neutral lipids were demonstrated using C30RP chromatography in positive ion mode to resolve triacylglycerol isomers in rat brain. The work presented here demonstrates how the enhanced approach can more routinely permit novel biomarker discovery, or lipid metabolism in a wide range of biological samples.},

Starting with raw MS data, the program detects and subsequently identifies potential metabolites. Moreover, a comparative analysis of a large number of chromatograms can be performed in either a targeted or nontargeted approach. MetaboliteDetector automatically determines appropriate quantification ions and performs an integration of single ion peaks. The analysis results can directly be visualized with a principal component analysis. Since the manual input is limited to absolutely necessary parameters, the program is also usable for the analysis of high-throughput data. However, the intuitive graphical user interface of MetaboliteDetector additionally allows for a detailed examination of a single GC/MS chromatogram including single ion chromatograms, recorded mass spectra, and identified metabolite spectra in combination with the corresponding reference spectra obtained from a reference library. MetaboliteDetector offers the ability to operate with highly resolved profile mass data. Finally, all analysis results can be exported to tab delimited tables. The features of MetaboliteDetector are demonstrated by the analysis of two experimental metabolomics data sets.

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is one of the most important macronutrients limiting plant growth and development, particularly in forest ecosystems such as temperate beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests in Central Europe. Efficient tree internal P-cycling during annual growth is an important strategy of beech trees to adapt to low soil-P. Organic P (Porg) is thought to play a decisive role in P-cycling, but the significance of individual compounds and processes has not been elucidated. To identify processes and metabolites involved in P-cycling of beech trees, polar-metabolome and lipidome profiling was performed during annual growth with twig tissues from a sufficient (Conventwald, Con) and a low soil-P (Tuttlingen, Tut) forest. Autumnal phospholipid degradation in leaves and P-export from senescent leaves, accumulation of phospholipids and glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P) in the bark, storage of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcNAc6P) in the wood, and establishing of a phospholipid ‘start-up capital’ in buds constitute main processes involved in P-cycling that were enhanced in beech trees on low-P soil of the Tut forest. In spring, mobilization of P from storage pools in the bark contributed to an effective P-cycling. Due to the higher phospholipid ‘start-up capital’ in buds of Tut beeches, the P-metabolite profile in developing leaves in spring was similar in beech trees of both forests. During summer, leaves of Tut beeches meet their phosphate (Pi) needs by replacing phospholipids by galacto- and sulfolipids. Thus, several processes contribute to adequate Pi-supply on P-impoverished soil thereby mediating similar growth of beech at low and sufficient soil-Pi availability.},

For the cell wall-less bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, glycerol derived from phospholipids of their human or animal hosts is the major source of carbon and energy. The lipids are first degraded by lipases, and the resulting glycerophosphodiesters are transported into the cell and cleaved to release glycerol-3-phosphate. Alternatively, free glycerol can be transported, and then become phosphorylated. The oxidation of glycerol-3-phosphate in Mycoplasma spp. as well as in related firmicutes involves a hydrogen peroxide-generating glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase. This enzyme is a key player in the virulence of Mycoplasma spp. as the produced hydrogen peroxide is one of the major virulence factors of these bacteria. In this review, the different components involved in the utilization of lipids and glycerol in Mycoplasma pneumoniae and related bacteria are discussed.},

Both dehydrogenase (DHA) and acid phosphomonoesterase (APA) activities were also significantly stimulated, due to the stimulation of microbial activity, whereas the β-glucosidase activity was unaffected. There was also a shift in bacterial biodiversity with growth of bacterial strains using lactic acid as a C source. The bacteria enriched belonged to the plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPb), such as Rhizobium and Azotobacter genus, involved in N2 fixation, and Pseudomonas and Bacillus genera, involved in phosphorous bioavailability.

The addition of EM 4 to soil amended with fresh green grass increased the growth of cucumber over that of the unamended and fertilized controls, while woodchips appeared to suppress growth. The yield of mustard and radish (tops and roots) were significantly higher with EM 4 at all dilution levels than either of the controls. However, mustard yield was highest at the 1:500 dilution, while there was little difference in radish yield for the dilutions used. Populations of fungi, lactobacilli, aerobic bacteria, and actinomycetes were generally higher in soil treated with EM 4 than for the unamended controls. Results indicate that EM 4 can accelerate the decomposition of organic amendments in soils and the release of their nutrients for plant growth.

Glycerophospholipids comprise critical components of the dual-membrane envelope of Gram-negative bacteria and participate in many processes. The new evidence suggests that, in some instances, distinct E. coli GPL molecules function for distinct biochemistry and bacteria sense perturbations in membrane GPL concentrations to coordinate survival strategies.

	abstract = {Biological cycling of silica plays an important role in terrestrial primary production. Soil warming stemming from climate change can alter the cycling of elements, such as carbon and nitrogen, in forested ecosystems. However, the effects of soil warming on the biogeochemical cycle of silica in forested ecosystems remain unexplored. Here we examine long-term forest silica cycling under ambient and warmed conditions over a 15-year period of experimental soil warming at Harvard Forest (Petersham, MA). Specifically, we measured silica concentrations in organic and mineral soils, and in the foliage and litter of two dominant species (Acer rubrum and Quercus rubra), in a large (30 × 30 m) heated plot and an adjacent control plot (30 × 30 m). In 2016, we also examined effects of heating on dissolved silica in the soil solution, and conducted a litter decomposition experiment using four tree species (Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra, Betula lenta, Tsuga canadensis) to examine effects of warming on the release of biogenic silica (BSi) from plants to soils. We find that tree foliage maintained constant silica concentrations in the control and warmed plots, which, coupled with productivity enhancements under warming, led to an increase in total plant silica uptake. We also find that warming drove an acceleration in the release of silica from decaying litter in three of the four species we examined, and a substantial increase in the silica dissolved in soil solution. However, we observe no changes in soil BSi stocks with warming. Together, our data indicate that warming increases the magnitude of silica uptake by vegetation and accelerates the internal cycling of silica in in temperate forests, with possible, and yet unresolved, effects on the delivery of silica from terrestrial to marine systems.},

	abstract = {Global soil carbon (C) stocks are expected to decline with warming, and changes in microbial processes are key to this projection. However, warming responses of critical microbial parameters such as carbon use efficiency (CUE) and biomass turnover (rB) are not well understood. Here, we determine these parameters using a probabilistic inversion approach that integrates a microbial-enzyme model with 22 years of carbon cycling measurements at Harvard Forest. We find that increasing temperature reduces CUE but increases rB, and that two decades of soil warming increases the temperature sensitivities of CUE and rB. These temperature sensitivities, which are derived from decades-long field observations, contrast with values obtained from short-term laboratory experiments. We also show that long-term soil C flux and pool changes in response to warming are more dependent on the temperature sensitivity of CUE than that of rB. Using the inversion-derived parameters, we project that chronic soil warming at Harvard Forest over six decades will result in soil C gain of {\textless}1.0\% on average (1st and 3rd quartiles: 3.0\% loss and 10.5\% gain) in the surface mineral horizon. Our results demonstrate that estimates of temperature sensitivity of microbial CUE and rB can be obtained and evaluated rigorously by integrating multidecadal datasets. This approach can potentially be applied in broader spatiotemporal scales to improve long-term projections of soil C feedbacks to climate warming.},

Two complementary procedures for soil fractionation (particle-size fractionation vs. aggregate-size fractionation) were carried out on a control soil (not subjected to the influence of termites) and on the soil of the internal wall (IW) of the termite mounds. Irrespective of the termite species and the soil (control vs. IW), glucose and galactose were the most abundant sugars, representing respectively 28–44\%, and 21–28\% of the total amount of monosaccharides. The impact of the two termite species on the sugar content differed. For the fungus-growing termite, M. bellicosus, the total monosaccharide content in the IW was about half that of the control soil. Most of this decrease was due to the decline of glucose (34\% and 14\% of the total decrease) and galactose (14\% and 12\%) associated with the particle size of the sand (i.e. {\textgreater}200 µm and 50–200 µm), respectively. In contrast, the total sugar content was 4 times higher in the IW of C. niokoloensis mounds than in the control soil. At the particle-size level, this accumulation of monosaccharides was mainly due to the increase in glucose and galactose in the particle-size fractions 20–50 µm and 2–20 µm. The aggregate-size fractionation indicated that the accumulation of glucose was particularly evident in the aggregate-size fraction 20–50 µm isolated from the IW of the mounds of C. niokoloensis.},

Until now it was not known whether GABA exerts its effects in plants through the regulation of carbon metabolism or via an unidentified signalling pathway. Here, we demonstrate that anion flux through plant aluminium-activated malate transporter (ALMT) proteins is activated by anions and negatively regulated by GABA. Site-directed mutagenesis of selected amino acids within ALMT proteins abolishes GABA efficacy but does not alter other transport properties. GABA modulation of ALMT activity results in altered root growth and altered root tolerance to alkaline pH, acid pH and aluminium ions. We propose that GABA exerts its multiple physiological effects in plants via ALMT, including the regulation of pollen tube and root growth, and that GABA can finally be considered a legitimate signalling molecule in both the plant and animal kingdoms.},

We hypothesize that this strategy cannot be adopted by plants in ecosystems and environments with frequent alterations between high and low temperatures, because changes in lipid unsaturation are complex and require large energy inputs. To test this hypothesis, we used a lipidomics approach to profile changes in molecular species of membrane glycerolipids in two plant species sampled from alpine screes and in another two plant species grown in a growth chamber, with the temperature cycling daily between heat and freezing. We found that six classes of phospholipid and two classes of galactolipid showed significant changes, but the degree of unsaturation of total lipids and of three lysophospholipid classes remained unchanged. This pattern of changes in membrane lipids was distinct from that occurring during slow alterations in temperature. We propose two types of model for the adaptation of plants to temperature change: (1) remodeling of membrane lipids but maintenance of the degree of unsaturation are used to adapt to frequent temperature alterations; and (2) both remodeling and changes in the degree of unsaturation to adapt to infrequent temperature alterations.},

	abstract = {In nearly all large-scale terrestrial ecosystem models, soil respiration is represented as a function of soil temperature. However, the relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature is highly variable across sites and there is often a pronounced hysteresis in the soil respiration-temperature relationship over the course of the growing season. This phenomenon indicates the importance of biophysical factors beyond just temperature in controlling soil respiration. To identify the potential mechanisms of the seasonal soil respiration-temperature hysteresis, we developed a set of numerical models to demonstrate how photosynthesis, soil moisture, and soil temperature, alone and in combination, aﬀect the hysteresis relationship. Then, we used a variant of the model informed by observations of soil respiration, soil temperature, photosynthesis, and soil moisture from multiple mesic and semi-arid ecosystems to quantify the frequency of hysteresis and identify its potential controls. We show that the hysteresis can result from the seasonal cycle of photosynthesis (which supplies carbon to rhizosphere respiration), and soil moisture (which limits heterotrophic respiration when too low or too high). Using ﬁeld observations of soil respiration, we found evidence of seasonal hysteresis in 9 out of 15 site-years across 8 diverse biomes. Speciﬁcally, clockwise hysteresis occurred when photosynthesis preceded seasonal soil temperature and counterclockwise hysteresis occurred when photosynthesis lagged soil temperature. We found that across all sites, much of the respiration-temperature lag was explained by the decoupling of photosynthesis and temperature, highlighting the importance of recently assimilated carbon to soil respiration. An analysis of observations from 129 FLUXNET sites revealed that time lags between gross primary productivity (a proxy for canopy photosynthesis) and soil temperature were common phenomena, which would tend to drive counterclockwise hysteresis at low-latitude sites and clockwise hysteresis at high-latitude sites. Collectively, our results show that incorporating photosynthesis and soil moisture in the standard exponential soil respiration-temperature model (i.e., Q10 model) improves the explanatory power of models at local scales.},

	abstract = {Forest stands at the Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, receiving experimentally elevated N inputs have shown greatly increased N leaching loss yet still retain over 70\% of the added N in soils, presumably in organic form. Whether microbial or abiotic mechanisms are responsible for the high N retention is not well understood. We monitored soil respiration and extractable NH4N and NO3-N following monthly applications of NH4NO3 to a hardwood forest and a pine plantation during the ﬁfth year of chronic fertilizer applications (15 g N as NH4NO3 mÀ2 per year). We hypothesized that individual N applications would increase short-term soil respiration (within 1 month) in previously unamended and N-limited soil, but that little or no increase would occur following N applications to chronically N-amended soils, assumed to be carbon-limited to some degree after 5 years of N additions. Short-term soil respiration did not increase after N additions in either the chronically amended or previously untreated soils except for one instance in the latter. However, extractable N levels in both previously unamended plots returned to preapplication levels within 2 weeks of the N addition. This rapid disappearance of the applied N suggests microbial immobilization, but in all but one instance there was no accompanying CO2 efﬂux increase indicating increased microbial biomass growth. A model of N immobilization through microbial biomass production, driven by the observed apparent net N immobilization, predicted soil CO2 efﬂux 4–17 times greater than measured rates. Microbial biomass production does not appear to be the mechanism by which the fertilizer N immobilization occurred, according to our assumptions about microbial C:N ratios and carbon use efﬁciency. Hardwood stand average soil respiration rates over the study period were signiﬁcantly higher in the previously unamended plot than in the control, and the control and chronically N-treated plot respiration rates were similar. Soil respiration rates for all pine stand treatments were similar. These results are insufﬁcient to support our hypotheses concerning carbon versus nitrogen limitation in these soils. Our results, along with evidence from other studies, suggest that abiotic mechanisms play a role in the high retention of long-term N additions in these soils.},

Given the extent of organic and physical hydrocarbon chemistry, it is not surprising that industrial oleochemistry employs a wide range of thermal and catalytic reaction technologies as well as separation methods. Currently, the most widely used methods for altering the thermal and crystallization properties of fats are catalytic hydrogenation, hydrolysis, and transesterification, along with a variety of other chemical modifications. The plant oil and lipids find various industrial and technology applications in coatings and polymers, printing inks, lubricants, cosmetics/pharmaceuticals, leather processing, surfactants, solvents, hydraulic fluids, pesticide/herbicide adjuvants, glycerin (glycerol), and as fuels.

The warming-enhanced decay of soil organic matter also released enough additional inorganic nitrogen into the soil solution to support the observed increases in plant carbon storage. Although soil warming has resulted in a cumulative net loss of carbon from a New England forest relative to a control area over the 7-y study, the annual net losses generally decreased over time as plant carbon storage increased. In the seventh year, warming-induced soil carbon losses were almost totally compensated for by plant carbon gains in response to warming. We attribute the plant gains primarily to warming-induced increases in nitrogen availability. This study underscores the importance of incorporating carbon–nitrogen interactions in atmosphere–ocean–land earth system models to accurately simulate land feedbacks to the climate system.},

	abstract = {Adjustment of ecosystem root respiration to warmer climatic conditions can alter the autotrophic portion of soil respiration and influence the amount of carbon available for biomass production. We examined 44 published values of annual forest root respiration and found an increase in ecosystem root respiration with increasing mean annual temperature (MAT), but the rate of this cross-ecosystem increase (Q(10)= 1.6) is less than published values for short-term responses of root respiration to temperature within ecosystems (Q(10)= 2-3). When specific root respiration rates and root biomass values were examined, there was a clear trend for decreasing root metabolic capacity (respiration rate at a standard temperature) with increasing MAT. There also were tradeoffs between root metabolic capacity and root system biomass, such that there were no instances of high growing season respiration rates and high root biomass occurring together. We also examined specific root respiration rates at three soil warming experiments at Harvard Forest, USA, and found decreases in metabolic capacity for roots from the heated plots. This decline could be due to either physiological acclimation or to the effects of co-occurring drier soils on the measurement date. Regardless of the cause, these findings clearly suggest that modeling efforts that allow root respiration to increase exponentially with temperature, with Q(10) values of 2 or more, may over-predict root contributions to ecosystem CO2 efflux for future climates and underestimate the amount of C available for other uses, including net primary productivity.},

	abstract = {Cellulose is an abundant natural biopolymer on earth, found as a major constituent of plant cell wall in lignocellulosic form. Unlike other compounds cellulose is not easily soluble in water hence enzymatic conversion of cellulose has become a key technology for biodegradation of lignocellulosic materials. Microorganisms such as aerobic bacteria, fungi, yeast and actinomycetes produce cellulase that degrade cellulose by hydrolysing the β-1, 4-glycosidic linkages of cellulose. In contrast to aerobic bacteria, anaerobic bacteria lack the ability to effectively penetrate into the cellulosic material which leads to the development of complexed cellulase systems called cellulosome. Among the different environments, the sediments of mangrove forests are suitable for exploring cellulose degrading microorganisms because of continuous input of cellulosic carbon in the form of litter which then acts as a substrate for decomposition by microbe. Understanding the importance of cellulase, the present article overviews the diversity of cellulolytic microbes from different mangrove environments around the world. The molecular mechanism related to cellulase gene regulation, expression and various biotechnological application of cellulase is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen is quantitatively the most important nutrient that plants acquire from the soil. It is well established that plant roots take up nitrogen compounds of low molecular mass, including ammonium, nitrate, and amino acids. However, in the soil of natural ecosystems, nitrogen occurs predominantly as proteins. This complex organic form of nitrogen is considered to be not directly available to plants. We examined the long-held view that plants depend on specialized symbioses with fungi (mycorrhizas) to access soil protein and studied the woody heathland plant Hakea actites and the herbaceous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which do not form mycorrhizas. We show that both species can use protein as a nitrogen source for growth without assistance from other organisms. We identified two mechanisms by which roots access protein. Roots exude proteolytic enzymes that digest protein at the root surface and possibly in the apoplast of the root cortex. Intact protein also was taken up into root cells most likely via endocytosis. These findings change our view of the spectrum of nitrogen sources that plants can access and challenge the current paradigm that plants rely on microbes and soil fauna for the breakdown of organic matter.},

	abstract = {Plastoquinone (PQ) and ubiquinone (UQ) are two important prenylquinones, functioning as electron transporters in the electron transport chain of oxygenic photosynthesis and the aerobic respiratory chain, respectively, and play indispensable roles in plant growth and development through participating in the biosynthesis and metabolism of important chemical compounds, acting as antioxidants, being involved in plant response to stress, and regulating gene expression and cell signal transduction. UQ, particularly UQ10, has also been widely used in people’s life. It is effective in treating cardiovascular diseases, chronic gingivitis and periodontitis, and shows favorable impact on cancer treatment and human reproductive health. PQ and UQ are made up of an active benzoquinone ring attached to a polyisoprenoid side chain. Biosynthesis of PQ and UQ is very complicated with more than thirty five enzymes involved. Their synthetic pathways can be generally divided into two stages. The first stage leads to the biosynthesis of precursors of benzene quinone ring and prenyl side chain. The benzene quinone ring for UQ is synthesized from tyrosine or phenylalanine, whereas the ring for PQ is derived from tyrosine. The prenyl side chains of PQ and UQ are derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate through the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate pathway and/or acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA through the mevalonate pathway. The second stage includes the condensation of ring and side chain and subsequent modification. Homogentisate solanesyltransferase, 4-hydroxybenzoate polyprenyl diphosphate transferase and a series of benzene quinone ring modification enzymes are involved in this stage. PQ exists in plants, while UQ widely presents in plants, animals and microbes. Many enzymes and their encoding genes involved in PQ and UQ biosynthesis have been intensively studied recently. Metabolic engineering of UQ10 in plants, such as rice and tobacco, has also been tested. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent research progresses in the biosynthetic pathways of PQ and UQ and enzymes and their encoding genes involved in side chain elongation and in the second stage of PQ and UQ biosynthesis. Physiological functions of PQ and UQ played in plants as well as the practical application and metabolic engineering of PQ and UQ are also included.},

	abstract = {Cellular membranes act as structural components to define the boundaries of the cell and delineate subcellular compartments. Membranes also serve as scaffolds for diverse signaling events, and participate directly in essential metabolic processes. This chapter focuses on the predominant pathways of fatty acid biosynthesis, their modification, and on glycerolipid assembly in Chlamydomonas. It combines these in silico predictions with a thorough review of the experimentally verified pathways to present a comprehensive view of the identities and functions of genes involved in glycerolipid biosynthesis in Chlamydomonas. A distinguishing feature of lipid metabolism in Chlamydomonas is the lack of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), whose role appears to be partially assumed by the betaine lipid DGTS. The lack of PtdCho may also explain why chloroplast lipids in Chlamydomonas appear to be almost exclusively synthesized directly in the plastid. Several fatty acid desaturases have been isolated and characterized at the molecular level, and the biochemistry and genetics of fatty acid chain elongation and desaturation in Chlamydomonas are discussed here. Glycerophospholipids are the prevalent lipids in non-photosynthetic organisms. They are characterized by a phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) backbone. In plants, approximately one-third of the organic phosphorus is found in Phosphoglycerolipids and the biosynthesis of glycerolipid covers this.},
